# PortfolioWebAPI
.NET Web API Used for my various Portfolio demos.

## Note
To not hassle any previewers of my demos with dev certificates I have opted to use the basic 'http' protocol at port:5000 and have included swagger for API
definitions. The 'https' profile is included in the settings but my demos will use 'http'.  
`http://localhost:5000/swagger`

## Run
Before running any of my various demos that requires this Web API please
make sure that in instance of this is running. If using CLI the simple run
command will suffice.  
`dotnet run`
